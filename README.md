# DungeonLife:
## Notes:
New Schematics Have Been Added!
SAVING:  Type in 'save' to get your code, copy it and then later load the game then type 'load'. After that, paste in your code and it will run like normal.
NON-PERMANENT DEATH:  When you die, it is no longer permanent.  (Although it is suggested you save before you get sent 5 levels back!)
TUTORIAL:  Now, you don't need me to explain the game!
MINIBOSSES:  As you go on your way (after beating the game, of course), you will encounter baddies that are stronger than normal, but do not quite count as bosses.  These dimensional baddies are minibosses.  Have fun with the new loot.
